        <h2 class="text-center">FlexBox Demo</h2> 

        <p class="main-text">
            FlexBox aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align 
            and distribute space among items in a container even when their 
            size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, 
            and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger 
            scale layouts.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-center">Basics & Terminology</h2> 

        <p class="main-text">
            Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves 
            a whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the 
            container (parent element, known as "flex container") whereas the others 
            are meant to be set on the children (said "flex items").
        </p>

        <p class="main-text">
            If "regular" layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, 
            the flex layout is based on "flex-flow directions". 
        </p>

        <p class="point-to-note">
            Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) 
            or the cross axis (from cross-start to cross-end).
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                main axis - The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along 
                which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; 
                it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).
            </li>

            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                <strong>main-start / main-end </strong>  - The flex items are placed within the container 
                starting from main-start and going to main-end.
            </li>

            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                <strong>main size</strong> - A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main 
                dimension, is the item's main size. The flex item's main size 
                property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is 
                in the main dimension.
            </li>

            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                <strong>main size</strong>
                - A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main 
                dimension, is the item's main size. The flex item's main size property 
                is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main 
                dimension.
            </li>

            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                <strong>cross axis</strong> - The axis perpendicular to the main axis is 
                called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.
            </li>

            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                <strong>cross-start / cross-end</strong> - Flex lines are filled with items 
                and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex 
                container and going toward the cross-end side.
            </li>

            <li class="list-point-to-note">
                <strong>cross size</strong>  - The width or height of a flex item, whichever 
                is in the cross dimension, is the item's cross size. The cross size property 
                is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-center">Properties for the Parent
            (flex container)</h2> 

        <p class="point-to-note">
            <strong>display</strong> :
            <br>
            <br>
            This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. 
            It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
        </p>
        <code class="code-snip">
            <span class="class">.container</span> { <span class="prop">display</span>: flex; 
            <span class="comment">/* or inline-flex */</span> }
        </code>


        <p class="point-to-note">
            <strong>flex-direction</strong> :
            <br>
            <br>
            This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed 
            in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction 
            layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal 
            rows or vertical columns.
